      <h1>4. Monoids</h1>

      <h2>4.1 What is a monoid?</h2>

      <p>
        A monoid is based around a very simple idea: you can combine things together to something bigger. For example, I
        can
        combine the numbers 3 and 5 together in a bigger number: 8. This combining of small things into bigger things is
        a
        concept that we will see recurring in programming.
      </p>

      <p>But a monoid is not just something of which I can combine things together to other things. Of course this is
        still
        mathematics and there has to be some formal definition. Well, here it goes: a monoid is a set which has a
        operation
        (function) that combines two items from that set into another item of that set. There is also a neutral item
        that when
        used with the function will result in the other item that was provided. The operator of the monoid is called
        join and is
        a binary operator. The neutral item is called unit. To make this more clear we can look at some examples:
      </p>

      <p>

        The definition of a monoid can be given with two mathematical laws that describe the conditions for something to
        be
        called a monoid: the identity law and the associativity law.
      </p>
      <p>
        One final note before we continue: I’m going to be a bit loose with the definition of the equality operator in
        this
        chapter. Equality over here is the deep-equality you might have seen before in some JavaScript libraries.
        Basically it
        boils down to that we don’t care about references. So two empty arrays are here equal, even when they would
        return false
        when compared in TypeScript. Another way of saying this is that we look to value-equality or
        structural-equality. So:
      </p>
      <pre>
        [ ] == [ ] // true
        [ 1, 2 ] == [ 1, 2 ] // true
        [ 1 ] == [ 2 ] // false
        { foo: 1 } == { foo: 1 } // true
        { foo: 1 } == { bar: true } // false
      </pre>

      <h2>4.2 Identity law</h2>
      <p>
        The identity law describes how the unit (or neutral) item has to behave. When the unit is used with join in
        combination
        with any item X from the set, the result has to be X. So for numbers and addititoin unit is zero because X + 0 =
        X. And
        for strings it is the empty string because: X + “” = X. We can write this definition down as:
      </p>
      <pre>
      join(x, unit) == join(unit, X) == X
      </pre>
      <p>
        And we can define our join functions and identities in TypeScript quit easily for a wide variety of monoids, as
        is shown
        below. Further down this chapter we will look at some more unique and complex monoids and there I will show you
        more
        examples.
      </p>
      <pre>
      let join = (a, b) => a + b
      let id = 0
      let x = join(3, id) // 3
      
      let join = (a, b) => a.concat(b)
      let id = []
      let x = join([ 1, 2, 3 ], []) // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
      </pre>

      <h2>4.3 Associativity law</h2>
      <p>
        The associativity law describes (partially) how the join operator has to behave . If I use this operator
        multiple times
        in an expression, the order in which I execute the joins shouldn’t matter. The order of the items in the
        expression
        could matter, like it does for strings and arrays. This is probably easier if I just write the law down:
      </p>
      <pre>
      join(x, join(y, z)) == join(join(x, y), z)
      </pre>
      <p>
        No matter which join I resolve first, the result has to be the same. This can also be shown with some TypeScript
        examples:
      </p>
      <pre>
      let join = (a, b) => a + b
      let id = 0
      let x = join(1, join(2, 3)) // 6
      let y = join(join(1, 2), 3) // also 6
      
      let join = (a, b) => a.concat(b)
      let id = []
      let x = join([ 1 ], join([ 2 ], [ 3 ]) // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
      let x = join(join([ 1 ], [ 2 ]), [ 3 ]) // also [ 1, 2, 3 ]
      </pre>

      <h2>4.4 Functions as monoids</h2>
      <p>
        There are many monoids but there is a very important but less obvious one I want to talk about: functions. A
        function is
        also a monoid. They do have a binary operator that takes two functions and makes them into one function:
        composition.
        They also have an identity: the identity function x => x (hence the name). For a function to be a monoids we do
        need a
        set of functions that do all have the same return type as argument type or we are not able to compose them at
        will.
      </p>
      <pre>
      let id = x => x
      let join = (f, g) => x => g(f(x))
      </pre>
      <p>
        The identity function makes no mutation to whatever you feed it, so this makes the identity law easy to
        understand for
        this one. The function we compose id with just does its thing and then the identity function does nothing with
        the
        result, resulting in whatever the first function returned.
      </p>
      <pre>
      join(id)(x => x + x) == x => x + x
      </pre>
      <p>
        The associativity law can be shown by combining three function together where we vary which two functions we
        compose
        first. No matter which in which order we compose the functions, we will always end up with the equivalent of x
        =>
        h(g(f(x))).
      </p>
      <pre>
      join(f, join(g)(h)) == join(join(f)(g))(h)
      </pre>
      <p>
        Functions and composition being a good example of a curtain abstraction or concept is something that will coming
        back
        and shows you how powerful functions and function composition exactly are.
      </p>

      <h2>4.5 Booleans as monoids</h2>

      <p>
        Booleans are also a type for which we have multiple binary operators: and and or. For both of them we can find
        an
        identity value and define a monoid. Because there are only two booleans it is very easy to just check all
        possible
        cases
        we can create with the binary operators. For and the identity value is true:
      </p>
      <pre>
      let id = true
      id && true == true && id == true
      id && false == false && id == false

      b1 && (b2 && b2) == (b1 && b2) && b3
      </pre>
      <p>
        The associativity law also holds up for and, no matter in which order you combine the operator and three
        booleans,
        you
        only get true if all of them are true and you will get false if only one of them is false. The order doesn’t
        matter. For
        or the identity value is false:
      </p>
      <pre>
      let id = false
      id || false == false || id == false
      id || true == true || id == true

      b1 || (b2 || b3) == (b1 || b2) || b3
      </pre>
      <p>
        And associativity follows the same logic as for or as it did for and: if just one of your three booleans is
        true,
        you
        get true and if all are false you get false. Order also doesn’t matter here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those monoids have more consequences then you would imagine at first. One example is the short-circuiting of
        JavaScript.
        If an && get evaluated and the first argument evaluates to false, it will directly return false without
        bothering
        to
        look to right expression. This works because if the first item is not the identity, it will affect the outcome
        and
        always be false. The same is true for the ||. If the first expression is not the identity it will affect the
        outcome to
        always be true.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another example is the every and some methods of arrays. some on an array uses the or operator on all the
        results
        of the
        provided function to decide if it will return true of false. But if there are no items you will get false
        because
        that
        is the identity value of the or operator. On the other hand, every on an empty array returns true because that
        is
        the
        identity value of and.
      </p>
      <pre>
      [].every(x => true) // true
      [].every(x => false) // true
      [].some(x => true) // false
      [].some(x => false) // false
      </pre>

      <h2>4.6 Monoids and reduce</h2>
      <p>
        A very practical ability of monoids is that they can be used with the reduce method on arrays. If you have an
        array of
        monoids, you can use the join function to reduce them to one with the identity value as the initial value:
      </p>
      <pre>
      let join = (a, b) => a + b
      let id = 0
      [1,2,3].reduce(join, id)

      let join = (f, g) => x => g(f(x))
      let id = x => x
      [x => x + x, x => x * x].reduce(join, id)
      </pre>
      <p>
        In the previous chapter we saw how monoids have influenced the behaviour of some and every. To illustrate this
        better we
        can define those functions with the help of reduce and our monoids, in similar fashion to how we just used
        reduce
        with
        functions and numbers:
      </p>
      <pre>
      let and = (a, b) => a && b
      let id = true
      let every = (a: boolean[]) => a.reduce(and, id)

      let or = (a, b) => a || b
      let id = false
      let some = (a: boolean[]) => a.reduce(or, id)
      </pre>

      <h2>4.7 Types as monoids</h2>
      <p>
        Not just values of some types are monoids, types themself are also monoids. In TypeScript we do have multiple
        binary
        operators for types which we can combine with their neutral type to create type monoids. You will see that those
        form a
        very solid foundation for type algebra.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most well-known type operator is the |. This operator combines two types with an ‘or’. This type is also
        called the
        sum type because the amount of possible values of the resulting type is the amount of possible values of the
        first
        type
        plus the amount of possible types of the other second type. To define a monoid with this operator we need an
        identity
        that has zero possible values (N possible values + zero possible values = N possible values). Luckily we have
        such
        an
        type: never.
      </p>
      <pre>
        type join&#x26;#x3C;a, b&#x3E; = a | b
        type id = never
        
        type x = join&#x26;#x3C;number, never&#x3E; // just number, try it in vscode
      </pre>
      <p>
        We can also verify the associativity law of this operator. Because of the syntax rule we can only define two
        ways of
        combining tree type tother (there are no parentheses we can use to create the third one we did have with
        other
        monoids). All of them result into number|string|boolean.
      </p>
      <pre>
          type u = join&#x3C;number, join&#x3C;string, boolean&#x3E;&#x3E;
          type v = join&#x3C;join&#x3C;number, string&#x3E;, boolean&#x3E;
      </pre>
      <p>
        Another monoid we can define with types is the product type. A product type takes two types and gives you
        a tuple with those two types. This means that we can combine every possible value from the first type with
        all the possible values from the second type. As a result of this the combined amount of possible values is
        the
        amount of possible values from the first type times the amount of possible values of the second type. To
        make a
        monoid out of this join operator we need a type that has only one possible value that we can combine with
        all
        possible values of a given type. For this I will use an empty object (one could also use null, but depending
        on
        your tsconfig null is part of all types and that is not what we want). Other languages have a special
        builtin
        type for this called Unit.
      </p>
      <pre>
        type Unit = {}

        type join&#x3C;a, b&#x3E; = [a, b]
        type id = Unit

        type x = join&#x3C;boolean, {}&#x3E; // [true, {}] | [false, {}]
      </pre>
      <p>
        The associativity law is also valid for this operator. Every possible order to compose our joins
        together
        result in a type that has a number, string and a boolean in a nested tuple. The specific nesting does
        differ, but that is fine. We do still store the same information with the same restrictions on the
        specific
        items.
      </p>
      <pre>
        type u = join&#x3C;number, join&#x3C;string, boolean&#x3E;&#x3E;
        type v = join&#x3C;join&#x3C;number, string&#x3E;, boolean&#x3E;
      </pre>
      <p>
        There is one more type operator in TypeScript: &. This operator merges two objects together to an
        object
        type which has the key-value pairs of both objects. While it is possible to use this operator on
        primitive types in TypeScript, it is a bit weird and most of the time not what you want. So for
        the
        monoid definition I have restricted it to objects:
      </p>
      type join&#x3C;a extends object, b extends object&#x3E; = a &#x26; b
      type id = Unit

      type x = join&#x3C;{ x: number }, { y: number }&#x3E;
      </pre>
      <p>
        When combining three objects together the order doesn’t matter, showing the associativity of
        this
        operator. Both examples below result into the same 3d vector type.
      </p>
      <pre>
        type u =
        join&#x3C;{ x: number }, join&#x3C;{ y: number }, { z: number }&#x3E;&#x3E;
        type u =
        join&#x3C;join&#x3C;{ x: number }, { y: number }&#x3E;, { z: number }&#x3E;
      </pre>
      <p>
        To really understand this operator is it good to compare it with the product type of two
        objects. If you fade-out the additional parentheses the product has you do end up with
        almost
        the same as a single object that has both sets of key-value pairs. The & operator is very
        close
        to a product, with the main difference being that is represents the common JavaScript
        pattern of
        merging two objects into one object instead of creating a tuple with two objects.
      </p>
      <pre>
        [ { x: number }, { y: number } ]
        { x: number } & { y: number }

        [ { x: number }, { y: number } ]
        { x: number } & { y: number }
      </pre>
      <p>
        There is a bit of a gotcha with this operator that makes it a bit less perfect as a
        monoid. If
        you have two objects that have the same key it will not be the same as the product type.
        If you
        try to merge two properties with the same key and different types you end up with never.
        If they
        have the same type you will end up with that type. This means that the & is not always the
        perfect multiplication of possible instances of two types like the product type always is.
      </p>
